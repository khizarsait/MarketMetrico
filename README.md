# Market Metrico: An In-Depth Analysis of Correlating ROI, CPC, and Acquisition Costs Across Advertising Channels

## Description

Market Metrico is an advanced analytical project designed to explore the intricate relationships between Return on Investment (ROI), Cost Per Click (CPC), and Customer Acquisition Costs across various advertising channels. Utilizing data from prominent social media platforms such as Facebook, Google, Email, and YouTube, this project aims to uncover actionable insights that can enhance marketing strategies and optimize advertising spend.

Built with R, Market Metrico leverages powerful data analysis and visualization techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of advertising metrics.

## Features

- **Data Aggregation**: Collects and integrates advertisement data from multiple social media platforms.
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensures data accuracy through thorough preprocessing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Offers detailed EDA to identify patterns and trends.
- **Visualization**: Presents data insights through various visualization techniques.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducts correlation analysis to explore relationships between key metrics.
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed reports to summarize findings and recommend optimizations.

## Requirements

- R (version 4.0.0 or later)
- RStudio (optional but recommended)
- R packages:
  - `dplyr` - Data manipulation
  - `readr` - CSV file reading
  - `DataExplorer` - Data exploration
  - `DT` - Displaying tables in Rmarkdown
  - `ggplot2` - Plotting graphs
  - `heatmaply` - Creating heatmaps
  - `kableExtra` - Managing markdown content
  - `tidyr` - Enhancing text visibility
  - `caret` - Handling regression models
  - `e1071` - Building Support Vector Models
  - `cluster` - Building clustering models
  - `forecast` - Time series analysis

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
